name: build-zapret2-locally
description: Build, verify, and optionally publish Zapret2 stable artifacts, or build development artifacts from the current worktree, entirely on the trusted local machine. Use for stable/release/production builds, dev/development/test builds, APK or Magisk ZIP assembly, signing verification, stable Forgejo publication, or diagnosis of either local build channel. Forgejo Actions is background validation only.

# Build Zapret2 Locally

## Protect signing state

- Treat `/home/codex-pve/.config/zapret2-signing` as durable private state.
- Never delete, move, regenerate, overwrite, commit, upload, or print its contents.
- Read individual JSON values only with `jq`; never enable shell tracing.
- Require mode `700` on the directory and `600` on confidential files.
- Use the existing production signer for both channels so dev APKs remain
  install-compatible with stable. Never substitute another signer.
- Read signing values from `signing-secrets.json`; the historical GitHub-named
  private file is not part of the Forgejo release contract.

## Select the channel

Use `stable` for a production candidate. Require a clean `main` exactly equal to
`origin/main`. Build the immutable commit, run every local qualification, produce
release-bound `update.json`, and allow publication only after explicit authorization.

Use `dev` for testing the current worktree, including non-ignored uncommitted and
untracked source files. Snapshot without modifying the worktree, assign a unique
`v<VERSION>-dev.<timestamp>.<sha>` identity, run the same local qualifications, and
produce production-signed APK/ZIP artifacts plus `build-info.json`. Never create
  `update.json`, a tag, a Forgejo Release, or `Latest` from dev output.

## Build locally

Run exactly one channel:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=/home/codex-pve/magisk-zapret2/.codex/skills/build-zapret2-locally

"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-local-release.sh" \
  --channel stable \
  --repo /home/codex-pve/magisk-zapret2

"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-local-release.sh" \
  --channel dev \
  --repo /home/codex-pve/magisk-zapret2
```

Require source/release policy, full shell tests, Android unit tests, release lint,
package validation, checksums, and production signer verification in both channels.
Keep only the latest successful default output per channel:

- stable: `.artifacts/local-releases/v<VERSION>/`
- dev: `.artifacts/dev-builds/v<VERSION>-dev.<timestamp>.<sha>/`

Report the channel, source commit and snapshot digest, version, output directory,
checksums, qualification results, and public signer digest.

## Publish stable only

Publish only after the user explicitly asks to release/deploy stable:

```bash
/home/codex-pve/magisk-zapret2/.codex/skills/build-zapret2-locally/scripts/publish-stable-release.sh \
  --repo /home/codex-pve/magisk-zapret2
```

Require an increasing `versionCode`, an absent immutable `v<VERSION>` tag/Release,
the exact pushed source SHA, five exact assets, and the production signer. Create a
non-draft, non-prerelease Release, mark it `Latest`, then verify the remote tag,
flags, bytes, update metadata, clean worktree, and preserved signing state.

Treat Forgejo Actions as independent background validation. Observe its run after a
push but never wait for it as a build or publication prerequisite. Never let Actions
create or mutate tags or Releases.
